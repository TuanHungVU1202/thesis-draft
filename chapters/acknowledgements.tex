I am profoundly grateful to Dr.Trinh Hoang Hon for his expert guidance and continuous encouragement throughout to see that this project rights its target since its commencement to its completion.

Again, I would like to express deepest appreciation towards Dr.Trinh Hoang Hon, whose invaluable guidance supported us in completing this project. He inspired me as similarly as equipped me with more knowledge about my major.

At last I must express our sincere heartfelt gratitude to all the staff members of Electrical and Electronics Engineering faculty who helped me directly or indirectly during this course of work.
