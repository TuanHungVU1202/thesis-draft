Nowadays, an Automation Home is not a new definition for people, especially with the evolution of the technology. In comparison to the old days, in which people were not even think about controlling light in a far distance without touching the button, but things have changed, now people can do even more than that. In addition, controlling devices in a house now can be done in a very long distance with an easy click or probably a tap from a smart device like smartphone or personal computer. Furthermore, with the purpose of maximization the convenience for everyday life, scenarios are built to satisfy specified scenarios in everyday routine. Not to mention, with the raising of the trend to analyze collected data, people can develop even more features to serve people life.

This thesis is implemented with the basic features of an automation house such as controlling devices in decent distance in an effortless way, or the owner can control the devices in different rooms with physical or virtual switches. Last but not least, it is successfully built in with a Web Server to control devices from endless distance and a Security Camera block to open door automatically with Facial Recognition system. The Database is also integrated in every steps of the system in order to collect data for maintaining system and using for further development.
